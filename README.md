# 👋 Hi there, I'm Tasir Rahman

A builder at the intersection of **curiosity, engineering discipline, and rapid iteration**.  
My development ethos is simple: **fail fast, learn faster, and ship better systems every cycle**.

I treat mistakes as **data points**, iteration as **momentum**, and quality as the **release gate**.

## 🧠 Engineering Principles

- Design systems for scale, not for today  
- Create UI & features that turn users into customers  
- Ship only when it meets quality benchmarks  
- Security is the foundation, never optional
